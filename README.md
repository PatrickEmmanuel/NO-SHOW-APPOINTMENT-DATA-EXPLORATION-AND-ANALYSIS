# Udacity Project 1: No-show Appointment Data Exploration And Analysis


## Introduction

This Analysis is aimed at determining key factors that determins whether a patient would show up 
for their medical appointment or not. 

The dataset is a collection of information regarding the medical appointments of more than 
100k patients and 14 features in Brazil. 

## Research Question

The questions we would try answer are as follows:
1. Does the scheduled day of appointment determines  whether a patient would show up for their appointment or not?
2. Are patients with critical health(s) condition more likely to show up for their appointment?
3. Does the neighborhood or location of the hospital a critical factor in patients showing up for their appointment?
4. Are patients enrolled in the social welfare program more likely to keep their appointment?

## Conclusion 

 From the analysis and exploration, appointments are more likely to be kept if they are scheduled within the 5th month and 6th month. Also, we saw that about 80% of scheduled appointments for those patient under scholarship were kept, hence patients on scholarship are more likely to show up for their appointments. Also, hypertensive patients are more likely to show up for their appointments than other patients. Finally, patients in certain locations tends have the tendency of keeping their appointments than those in certain region.

Age did not have significant effect on a patient missing his appointment or not as the age distribution of those show up for their appointment vs those who did not show are similar in shape.
